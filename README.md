This test application has also been deployed to firebase hosting and is available for trying out at the following url:- https://high-horse-react-test.firebaseapp.com/

The attached design did not contain any indication for expanded/collapsed comments, but the requirements called for it, so I added an expand/collapse icon to all comments.
Also, I did not have time to find exact matching icons as the screenshot, so I just included the closest matching ones from the material icons. Sorry about that.
